- 👋 Hi, I’m @mehmettunahanokumus
I study Geophysical Engineering at Istanbul Technical University. I am trying to develop myself on different branches such as Data Science and Machine Learning.
While I was taking courses about data processıng and programming I noticed that I should work on data more. And I started to take courses about
Data Science and Python Programming. I share my projects and exercises repositories on this account.
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Science and Python programming.
