🚀 Hey, I’m Mehmet Tunahan Okumus (Tuna)

I work in Cybersecurity / Information Security, focusing on strengthening my technical depth while building toward industry-standard certifications. My interests sit at the intersection of security and intelligent systems — everything from AI and ML to automation, cloud security, and defensive engineering.

I originally studied Geophysical Engineering at Istanbul Technical University, but shifted gears after realizing I was far more energized by data-driven problem-solving and security work. Since then, I’ve been sharpening my skills across:
	•	Information Security & Cybersecurity Fundamentals
	•	Python and security-focused tooling
	•	AI/ML concepts, models, and practical applications
	•	Cloud security foundations (Microsoft security stack in particular)

👀 Interests

Cybersecurity · Information Security · AI · Generative AI · Automation · Tech that actually solves problems
